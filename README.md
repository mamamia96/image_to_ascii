# image_to_ascii
This is my first attempt at converting an image to ascii characters. For now it only really works with pure black and white images. There is a small threshold to get some darker gray colors as well. I intend to update this in the future to try to parse different shades of grayscale with different characters

How to use:
- Pass a path to your image as an argument to the console_draw.py file. Or if no arguments are passed you will be prompted to enter a path to the file in question
- The image has to be of the .png extension
- This script is intended for use in the windows command line

As a sidenote there are some unused functions in console_draw that you may find of use if you want to customize your own ascii images :)
